    <h1 class = "head"> My Top 5 Favorite Instruments</h1>
    <p class = "text"><strong>I love music</strong> and I highly doubt that I am the only one who does. Music is a very special thing. It reaches a part of our soul that not many other things can reach. We know this because even back when there were no special technology and tools, humans were creating musical instruments. This goes to show the importance of music in human life. With that being said, musical instruments can come in many forms.<br> Here are <em>my</em> favorites.</p>

    <h3 class = "head"> 1. Saxophone</h3>
    <p class = "text">The saxophone is <strong>beautiful.</strong> That's pretty much all I can say about it. There is just <em>something</em> about it...something <em>melodic.</em> It just wooes your soul and leaves you in an <em>angelic</em> trance.</p>

    <h3 class="head"> 2. Piano </h3>
    <p class="text"> The piano is the most well known and most used musical instrument by far. </p>
